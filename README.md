- Install all packages under `requirements.txt`

- Need a `.nomterr.conf` config file under your `$HOME` which has your
  Open Weather Map API key as well as other definitions in it.  It is
  easy to get, register to OWM for free, and API key will be
  generated. Same for quandl.

An example `nomterr.conf` file looks like

```
{
  "guide_detail_dir": "/home/burak/Documents/kod/nomadicterrain/guide/doc/details",
  "spiller_pdf": "/home/burak/Documents/kod/nomadicterrain/static/spiller.json",
  "weatherapi": "[key]",
  "hay": "/dir/dir/etc",
  "quandl": "[quandl key]",
  "book_dir": "file:///home/burak/Documents",
  "osm_dir": "/mnt/3d1ece2f-6539-411b-bac2-589d57201626/home/burak/Downloads/osm/tr",

  "book_index_db": "/dir/dir/kitaplar-loogle.db",
  "book_dir": "/home/burak/Documents/kitaplar",
