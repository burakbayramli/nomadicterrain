# Nomadic Terrain

A Flask web app that carries features that could not be placed in
BBApps, on https://burakbayramli.github.io. BBApps runs on pure
HTML/Javascript, it has no server side functionality. What could not
be placed there is served via nomadicterrain. It is also the testbed
for BBApps, its client-only code can be tested via the files under
`static`.  To start simply run `main.py`.
